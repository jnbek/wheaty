# Wheaty

Wheaty is a Git powered node.js blog engine derived from [wheat]

## node.js + Git + Markdown = Blog
Are you a geek? And still using wordpress as your personal blog? You are totally out. Geeks use cool things. If you are a git follower and markdown writer, try this. A blog using markdown to present and git to store data, cool stuff, isn't it?

## how to install
    git clone git://github.com/zTrix/wheaty.git wheaty
    cd wheaty
    npm install -d
    git pack-refs --all
    node server.js

## note
* wheaty uses utf-8 as its default encoding, and it's strongly recommended to use utf-8. Though it's designed to support other encodings, but not enough tests have been done.
